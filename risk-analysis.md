# Layer 2 Risk Analysis
Layer 2 networks improve scalability but introduce additional technical and systemic risks.
## Smart Contract Risk
Bugs in rollup contracts can compromise funds.
Auditing and formal verification are critical mitigation strategies.
## Bridge Risk
Assets bridged between networks rely on contract integrity.
Bridge exploits have historically caused significant losses.
## Centralization Concerns
Some Layer 2 networks rely on centralized sequencers.
This creates potential censorship and uptime risks.
## Liquidity Fragmentation
Users must move assets between networks.
This can reduce capital efficiency across ecosystems.
## Governance Risk
Protocol upgrades may be controlled by small groups.
Insufficient decentralization may affect long-term trust.
## Economic Incentive Risk
Improper incentive design may weaken network security.
