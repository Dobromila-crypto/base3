# Layer 2 Performance Metrics
This document compares performance and economic metrics across major Layer 2 solutions.
## Cost Comparison
Layer 2 fees are typically a fraction of Ethereum mainnet fees.
## Speed Comparison
Batching enables faster confirmation times for users.
## Key Observations
- Rollups dominate the scaling roadmap.
- User adoption correlates strongly with fee reduction.
## Reflection
Layer 2 solutions are essential for scaling Ethereum but introduce new complexities.
## Example Comparative Overview
| Metric | Ethereum | Layer 2 |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Avg TPS | ~15 | 100+ (effective) |
| Avg Fee | High | Low |
| Settlement | Immediate | Batched |
