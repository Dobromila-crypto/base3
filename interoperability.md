Interoperability refers to the ability of different blockchain networks to communicate and transfer assets securely.
## Why Interoperability Matters
Layer 2 ecosystems fragment liquidity and users.
Bridging enables capital mobility between networks.
## Bridge Mechanisms
- Lock and mint
- Burn and release
- Liquidity-based bridges
## Interoperability Risks
Bridges represent one of the largest attack surfaces in crypto.
