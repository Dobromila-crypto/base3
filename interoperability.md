# Cross-Chain Interoperability
Interoperability refers to the ability of different blockchain networks to communicate and transfer assets securely.
## Why Interoperability Matters
Layer 2 ecosystems fragment liquidity and users.
Bridging enables capital mobility between networks.
## Bridge Mechanisms
- Lock and mint
- Burn and release
- Liquidity-based bridges
## Interoperability Risks
Bridges represent one of the largest attack surfaces in crypto.
## Trust Assumptions
Some bridges rely on multisig signers.
Others rely on cryptographic proofs.
## Future of Cross-Chain Communication
Native interoperability solutions are likely to reduce reliance on centralized bridge operators.
## Cross-Chain Messaging
Some solutions enable secure contract-to-contract communication between chains.
