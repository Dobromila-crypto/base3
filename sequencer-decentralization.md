# Sequencer Decentralization
Sequencers order Layer 2 transactions before submission to Ethereum.
## Current Model
Many Layer 2 networks operate with a single centralized sequencer.
## Centralization Risks
- Transaction censorship
- Downtime risk
- MEV capture concentration
## Decentralized Sequencer Design
Future models may include:
- Proof-of-stake sequencing
- Multi-sequencer rotation
- Shared sequencing layers
## Roadmap Considerations
Transitioning to decentralized sequencing requires economic and technical alignment.
## Open Research Questions
- How can decentralized sequencers prevent collusion?
- What incentive mechanisms ensure honest ordering?
- Can shared sequencing layers serve multiple rollups securely?
