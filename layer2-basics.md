# Understanding Layer 2 Blockchains
## What is Layer 2?
Layer 2 networks are built on top of Ethereum to improve speed and reduce costs.
They process transactions separately but rely on Ethereum for security.
## Why Layer 2 Networks Exist
Ethereum mainnet can become congested.
High demand leads to higher gas fees.
Layer 2 helps reduce this pressure.
