# Understanding Layer 2 Blockchains
## What is Layer 2?
Layer 2 networks are built on top of Ethereum to improve speed and reduce costs.
They process transactions separately but rely on Ethereum for security.
## Why Layer 2 Networks Exist
Ethereum mainnet can become congested.
High demand leads to higher gas fees.
Layer 2 helps reduce this pressure.
## Types of Layer 2 Solutions
- Optimistic Rollups
- ZK Rollups
- State Channels
- Sidechains
### Optimistic Rollups
They assume transactions are valid unless challenged.
Fraud proofs are used to detect incorrect transactions.
### ZK Rollups
They use zero-knowledge proofs to validate transactions.
This allows fast confirmation with strong security guarantees.
## Summary
Layer 2 solutions are essential for Ethereum scalability.
They enable lower fees and improved user experience.
