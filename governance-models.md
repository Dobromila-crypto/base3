# Governance Models in Layer 2 Networks
## Centralized Governance
Decisions are made by a core team or foundation.
This allows faster iteration but reduces decentralization.
## DAO-Based Governance
Token holders vote on protocol changes.
This model promotes decentralization but may slow decision-making.
## Hybrid Governance
Some networks transition from centralized to decentralized structures over time.
## Governance Trade-Offs
Balancing efficiency and decentralization is a key challenge for scaling networks.
## Token-Based Governance
Token holders propose and vote on protocol changes.
