# Governance Models in Layer 2 Networks
## Centralized Governance
Decisions are made by a core team or foundation.
This allows faster iteration but reduces decentralization.
## DAO-Based Governance
Token holders vote on protocol changes.
This model promotes decentralization but may slow decision-making.
